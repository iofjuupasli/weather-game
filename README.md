Interview Project:
===

The task is to create a game where a player presented with two cities and their goal is to guess which one is warmer right now. The correct answer adds a point to a score. The game must have a second page where the player can change the temperature units (Celsius or Fahrenheit) and see their game history (log). You must use React.

* http://openweathermap.org/ – you must use API for weather. This is our suggestion.
* https://app.moqups.com/atn.marsel@gmail.com/JlNglzxXJl/view/page/a8101feea – this a mockup (hold Shift to highlight interactive areas). The mockup is for understanding the task, not for replicating it exactly (although it's not forbidden).
